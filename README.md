# StorageExample
Example app that goes with Getting Started with Firebase Cloud Storage on https://www.ericdecanini.com/2018/02/17/getting-started-firebase-cloud-storage-android/

This app uses putBytes and getBytes to upload and download images of bears.

If you want me to make an example using the other upload and download methods (i.e. putStream() or getFile()) then leave it as a comment on my post! (I may not see it immediately here on Github)
